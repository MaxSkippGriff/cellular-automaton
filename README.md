## A simple cellular automaton

The board is randomly populated with growth and death cells. The probability of
growth and death can be altered to generate different cell dynamics/visuals.

The usleep() function is used to slow down the execution of current processes for
a number of microseconds. This allows you to view the emergence and destruction of
growth and death cells.

This simple cellular automaton is designed to refamiliarise myself with
C.

## Technologies
â€¢ ANSI C90  

## To Do

- Add death generation.
- Add function with rules about how cells influence/transform neighbouring cells.
- Add graphics.
- Add different variables such as wind.
